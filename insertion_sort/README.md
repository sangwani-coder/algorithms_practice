# INSERTION SORT
Insertion sort is an efficient sorting algorithm for sorting a small
number of elements. It places an unsorted element at its suitable place
in each iteration.

## How it works
Insertion sort works similary to the way you sort a hand of playing cards.
You start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the table.
You then removeone card at a time from the table and insert it into the
correct position in the left hand. To find the correct position of the card
you compare it with each of th cards in the hand from right to left. Each
time the left hand cards are sorted.

**Input**: A sequence of n numbers (X1, X2,....Xn).
**Output**: A reordering of the input sequence such that X1 <= X2<=..<=Xn.
The numbers that we wish to sort are also known as keys. Although we are 
sorting a sequence, the input comes to us in the form of an array with n
elements.

* **Implementation**
[insertion_sort.py](./nsertion_sort.py): Implementation in Python.
