# algoritms_practice
Im currenlty studuyign algorithms and created this repository to practice
implementing different types of algorithms.

## What are algorithms.
Informaly, an algorithm is any well-defined computation procedure that
takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some values,
or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of 
computational steps that transform input into the output.

## Correct algorithms
An algorithm is said to be correct if, for every input instance it halts
with the correct output.A correct algorithm solves the given computational
problem.

1. **INSERTION SORT**
[insetion_sort](./insertion_sort): Implementation of
the _insertion sort_ algorithm.

1. **MERGE SORT**
[merge_sort](./merge_sort): Implementation of the 
_merge sort_ algorithm.
